## Description

This Coding Quiz Challenge app was created to test students' knowledge of JavaScript based on five multiple choice questions. The quiz is timed, with 15 seconds being deducted every time the user gets an answer wrong. At the end, the user is given their score and an option to submit their initials along with their score. This website utilized web API's to change the content of the HTML, as well as make the website more interactive. I was able to learn how to better utilize web API's to create a well-functioning website.

## Usage

To use this website, the user simply clicks the "Start Quiz" button below the quiz directions. Once they click this button, the 75 second timer starts counting down. The user is taken to the first question. If they click a wrong answer, they are taken to the next question and "Wrong!" is displayed underneath the multiple choice options. If they click the right answer, they are taken to the next question and "Correct!" is displayed underneath the multiple choice options. Additionally, if they are incorrect, 15 seconds is deducted from their time. This same pattern repeats until they are donw with five multiple choice questions. 

After they are done taking the quiz, they are given their score, as well as a text box telling the user to input their initials. Located next to this text box is a "Submit" button where the user can submit their initials, which will be stored along with their quiz score. Student scores can be accessed via "View Highscores" in the upper left corner of the webpage.
